What is connect-flash?

👉 connect-flash is a way to send temporary messages between requests using sessions.

Think:

✅ “Login successful”

❌ “Invalid password”

⚠️ “Please log in first”

These messages:

Live for ONE request

Are shown once

Then auto-deleted

Basically: self-destructing messages 💣 (in a good way)

Behind the scenes:

User makes a request
You store a flash message in session
User is redirected
Next request reads the message
Message is deleted automatically
👉 That’s why sessions are mandatory.
workflow of flash connect

so bascially iss sab e session ki kya importance ::: toh internally ye flash messages are stored in sessin object 
HTTP forgets everything after a response.
Session is the memory that survives.

Session object (on server):

req.session = {
  userId: 42,
  isLoggedIn: true,
  flash: {
    error: ["Wrong password"]
  }
}                                   like this >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


worklflow of using these messages >>

require it 
app.use(flash());   in our app.js

ata apan te res.render("index.js,ya sobat goshti nahi patavanr apan res.locals banauu);

app.use((req,res,next)=>{
  res.locals.success = req.flash("success);


})
